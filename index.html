        Our goal has been to create a program to predict the amount of bicyclist you are likely to meet, when going out. To achieve
        this we have used <a href="http://www.hri.fi/fi/dataset/helsingin-pyorailijamaarat">data from the city of Helsinki</a>,
        which tells us the amount of bycyclists on a given location. We have combined this information with
        <a href="https://ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/avoin-data">weather data from Finnish Meteorological Institute</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        We wanted to see how much does weather and date affect the amount of bicyclists. We used linear regression, as was suggested
        in the project instructions. Some of the data showed clear linear connection, but for some it was less clear. It
        is possible that some of the data have more complex relationship, and a regression tree, for example, could have
        predicted better.

        Our best estimator was using Local Polynomial Regression, which was somewhat accurate. However our estimators were unable
        to explain all the variation in the data. We also had problems fetching realtime data from the FMI servers, and implementing
        the algorithm in the browser. For that we were unable to complete our realtime predictor for bicyclists. The rest
        of our codes are in
        <a href="https://github.com/tmakij/IntrToDataSci">github</a>.
